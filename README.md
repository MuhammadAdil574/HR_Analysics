# HR_Analysics

I evaluated an HR dataset about absenteeism and health. I provided a data driven approach to determine how to provide a bonus and incentive to healthy employees. I created a database, SQL queries to answer questions and build a dashboard which meets the requirments of The Client.  This is an end-to-end project that you can use to improve your skill.
